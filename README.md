# cd-plots
This repo provide some tools to compute and plot post-hoc Friedman statistical test.

In addition, this repository has two main sections, as follows: genetic and cdplot.

## Genetic
In this fold, there are a genetic algorithm that optimize the search for statistical diferences between the first column from others. Basically, it computes a serie of Nemenyi tests with different combinations of datasets selection (rows) and comparare with the other approachs (columns). It is focused to search in more significants results (count all times that the alpha is below 0.05).

## CDplot
As the main explain yourself, in this fold contais the code to generate a critical difference diagram.
